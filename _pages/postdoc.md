# Context 
High-energy theorists all apply to postdoctoral positions at the same time of the year. Applications are submitted before the holiday season (deadlines between November 15 and December 15). While there are on the order of 80-100 openings, these are mostly centralized in two systems: the [European Joint Application](https://itf.fys.kuleuven.be/postdoc-application/) and [AcademicJobsOnline](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo). Therefore, the effort required of applicants to submit a large number of applications is marginal. This results in a selection process that should be heavily dependant on measurable features based on the publication record of the applicants.

Admission decisions are usually issued between mid-December and February. An agreement between departments ensures that no position must be accepted or declined before January 7, leading to two rounds of offers usually being sent.

A fraction of applicants choose to publicize offers they have received on an unofficial “[Rumor Mill](https://sites.google.com/site/postdocrumor/)“. The information on that website includes the identity of the offer recipient, the date of the rumor submission and the status of the offer. Information is available since the 2011 application year.
