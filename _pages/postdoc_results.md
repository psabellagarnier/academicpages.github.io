The following applet displays histograms of various statistics about successful HEP-TH postdoc applicants for years 2017-2020. A detailed explanation is available [here](/postdoc/). Some UI notes:

* The top drop-down menu selects the different statistics.
* The x-axis can be switched between total count (“absolute”, with postdocs and PhD students stacked) and “relative” (overlaying percentage for postdocs and PhD students).
* The y-axis counts either reflect the count in a single x-axis bin (“interval”) or in all the bins up to that value (“cumulative”).
* The legend is interactive and can be used to filter the type of applicant: postdoc, PhD student or both (note that these were determined by training a model, therefore there is some inherent uncertainty associated with the classification).
